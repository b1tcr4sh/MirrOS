 # MirrOS
 
 A UI for DIY Raspberry Pi based smart mirrors built using [.NET](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/) and [AvaloniaUI](https://avaloniaui.net/).
 
 My progress will all be documented on this [Trello List](https://trello.com/b/sxiH7IPT), as well as what I have planned for the project.



(For reference, as of beginning this project, I have little to no experience with C# with this being my first venture into building UIs or using Avalonia)
